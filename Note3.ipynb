Object similarity is addressed through inheritance, which formalizes *is-a* relationships by abstracting shared behavior into superclasses and delegating specialization to subclasses. Inheritance is treated as a behavioral and type-theoretic contract, not merely a reuse mechanism. This lecture examines basic inheritance, inheritance from built-in types, multiple inheritance, and polymorphism with duck typing, emphasizing correctness, substitutability, and scalability in distributed, protocol-driven systems.\n"

        "\n",
        "- **Polymorphism:** All animals implement `speak()` and `move()` differently.  \n",
        "- **Multiple inheritance:** `Duck` inherits from both `Bird` and `Swimmer`.  \n",
        "- **Mixins:** `Swimmer` adds swimming capability without affecting other animals.  \n",
        "- **Default arguments:** Avoids `TypeError` for missing parameters.  \n",
        "- **Safe initialization:** `super().__init__()` ensures proper parent initialization.\n"
